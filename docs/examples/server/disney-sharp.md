# Server Example: Disney Sharp

This example portrays a movie and TV series web app. It separates each micro frontend in its own project - making them truly independent and deployable as individual pieces.

The example includes:

- App Shell project ("Flixx)
- Three micro frontend projects (Catalog, Details, Search)
- One empty micro frontend project showing how joint debugging / development works ("All")

The code for this example is available at [github.com/FlorianRappl/ddc24-devsession](https://github.com/FlorianRappl/ddc24-devsession).
