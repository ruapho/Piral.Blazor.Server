# Server Example: Tractor Shop

This example reconstructs the famous [Tractor Store v1](https://micro-frontends.org) example from Michael Geers. It separates each micro frontend in its own project - making them truly independent and deployable as individual pieces.

Besides the implementation of the Tractor Store the example also shows how debugging of individual pieces can work in a joint setup. For this a few extras have been included.

The example includes:

- App Shell project
- Three micro frontend projects (red, blue, green)
- One empty micro frontend project showing how joint debugging / development works

The code for this example is available at [github.com/FlorianRappl/Piral.Blazor.Server.Samples.Tractor](https://github.com/FlorianRappl/Piral.Blazor.Server.Samples.Tractor).
