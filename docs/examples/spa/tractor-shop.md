# SPA Example: Tractor Shop

This example reconstructs the [Tractor Store v2](https://micro-frontends.org/tractor-store/) example from Michael Geers. It separates each micro frontend in its own project - making them truly independent and deployable as individual pieces.

Besides the implementation of the Tractor Store the example also shows how debugging of individual pieces can work in a joint setup. For this a few extras have been included.

The example includes:

- App Shell project ("app")
- Three micro frontend projects (checkout, decide, explore)

The code for this example is available at [github.com/piral-samples/tractor-v2-blazor-wasm](https://github.com/piral-samples/tractor-v2-blazor-wasm).
