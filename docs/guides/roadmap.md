# Roadmap

In the future Piral.Blazor.Server will include:

- Loading of non-Blazor MFs at the server (does not imply rendering)
- Support for client-only MFs (rendering in the client)
- Integration with Picard to load and integrate components from other MFs
- Outline for compatibility / merger with `Piral.Blazor` (client library)
- Examples & improved DX for using `Piral.Blazor.Server` without a feed service
- Full integration in the Piral ecosystem

If you want to contribute to those (or other) topics then please get in touch.
