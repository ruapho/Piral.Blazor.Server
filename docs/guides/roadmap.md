# Roadmap

The 1.0.0 of `Piral.Blazor.Server` is expected end of Q4 2024 / beginning of Q1 2025. In the 1.0.0 we will include:

- Loading of MFs at the server
- Support for client-only MFs
- Integration with Picard to load and integrate components from other MFs
- Outline for compatibility / merger with `Piral.Blazor` (client library)
- Examples & improved DX for using `Piral.Blazor.Server` without a feed service
- Full integration in the Piral ecosystem
